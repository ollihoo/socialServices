# Flyway

Since the database is live now, we need a tool to manage database changes.

Flyway is a tool to manage these kind of changes (see
[Spring.io](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/how-to/data-initialization.html))
for more information.

Update scripts can be found here: [src/main/resources/db/migration](../src/main/resources/db/migration)
